== Building Kudu

=== System Requirements
The following dependencies are necessary to build kudu:

- autoconf
- automake
- boost >= 1.41, on CentOS boost-devel and boost-static,
  including the following components:
  - boost::thread
  - boost::system (thread depends on it)
- cmake 2.8.7
- curl
- gcc and g++ 4.4 or higher
- liboauth-dev
- libssl-dev (Ubuntu) or openssl-devel (CentOS)
- libsasl2-dev (Ubuntu) or cyrus-sasl-devel (CentOS)
- libtool
- patch
- python 2.6 or later
- ntp
- unzip
- pkg-config

Earlier versions of each of these may work, but have not recently
been tested.

Using Debian based distributions you can use the following command to install
all the required packages:
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake cmake curl gcc liboauth-dev libssl-dev\
libsasl2-dev libtool patch python ntp unzip libboost-all-dev pkg-config

=== Download and build thirdparty dependencies

Kudu depends on a number of third-party libraries and tools. In order to ensure
that developers have consistent versions of these libraries, the Kudu repository
includes scripts to automatically download and build these dependencies,
installing them into a source-tree-local install prefix.

To download, build, and install the thirdparty dependencies, you can issue the
following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ thirdparty/build-if-necessary.sh
----

When this command completes, the dependencies will be installed in
_thirdparty/installed/_. If you are looking to manually run the protobuf compiler `protoc`,
the `pprof` tool, etc, you can find these in _thirdparty/installed/bin/_

NOTE: The _build-if-necessary.sh_ script requires that it be run from within a git
repository in order to determine if the dependencies have changed. If you are building
from a source tarball, you must manually run the download and build steps yourself.

=== Automatic rebuilding of dependencies

The script is also invoked by cmake, so new thirdparty
dependencies added by other developers will be downloaded and built
automatically in subsequent builds if necessary.

To disable the automatic invocation of build-if-necessary.sh, set the
`NO_REBUILD_THIRDPARTY` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
$ NO_REBUILD_THIRDPARTY=1 cmake .
----

This can be particularly useful when trying to run tools like `git bisect`
between two commits which may have different dependencies.


.Building thirdparty with gcc 4.4 (eg on RHEL6)
[NOTE]
====
The LLVM thirdparty dependency will not build properly with gcc 4.4, which is
the version of gcc shipped with RHEL6. If your machine has a newer compiler such as
LLVM 3.3 available, you can use that compiler to bootstrap the thirdparty LLVM:

[source,bash]
----
$ export CC=/REPLACE/WITH/YOUR/PATH/llvm-3.3/bin/clang
$ export CXX=/REPLACE/WITH/YOUR/PATH/llvm-3.3/bin/clang++
$ thirdparty/build-if-necessary.sh
----

If you don't have access to a newer compiler, you can build LLVM twice, once
without the gcc 4.4 incompatible code, and once with. Add the flag
`-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_COMPILER_RT_BUILD=OFF` to the cmake invocation for LLVM in
_thirdparty/build-thirdparty.sh_. When built, that will yield an incomplete but
otherwise working LLVM 3.4. Then, using the `CC`/`CXX` environment variables as
above, remove the aforementioned flag and rebuild LLVM using itself.
====


=== Building Kudu itself


[source,bash]
----
# Add <root of kudu tree>/thirdparty/installed/bin to your $PATH
# before other parts of $PATH that may contain cmake, such as /usr/bin
# For example: "export PATH=$HOME/git/kudu/thirdparty/installed/bin:$PATH"
# if using bash
$ cmake .
$ make -j8  # or whatever level of parallelism your machine can handle
----

The build artifacts, including the test binaries, will be stored in
_build/latest/_, which itself is a symlink to a build-type specific
directory such as _build/debug_ or _build/release_.

To omit the Kudu unit tests during the build, add -DNO_TESTS=1 to the
invocation of cmake. For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cmake -DNO_TESTS=1 .
----

== Running unit/functional tests

To run the Kudu unit tests, you can use the `ctest` command from within the
root of the Kudu repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ ctest -j8
----

This command will report any tests that failed, and the test logs will be
written to _build/test-logs_.

Individual tests can be run by directly invoking the test binaries in
_build/latest_. Since Kudu uses the Google C++ Test Framework (gtest),
specific test cases can be run with gtest flags:

[source,bash]
----
# List all the tests within a test binary, then run a single test
$ ./build/latest/tablet-test --gtest_list_tests
$ ./build/latest/tablet-test --gtest_filter=TestTablet/9.TestFlush
----

gtest also allows more complex filtering patterns. See the upstream
documentation for more details.

=== Running tests with the clang AddressSanitizer enabled


AddressSanitizer is a nice clang feature which can detect many types of memory
errors. The Jenkins setup for kudu runs these tests automatically on a regular
basis, but if you make large changes it can be a good idea to run it locally
before pushing. To do so, you'll need to build using `clang`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm -Rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
$ CC=$(pwd)/thirdparty/installed/bin/clang \
  CXX=$(pwd)/thirdparty/installed/bin/clang++ \
  cmake -DKUDU_USE_ASAN=1 .
$ make -j8
$ make test
----

The tests will run significantly slower than without ASAN enabled, and if any
memory error occurs, the test that triggered it will fail. You can then use a
command like:


[source,bash]
----
$ build/latest/failing-test 2>&1 | thirdparty/asan_symbolize.py | c++filt | less
----

to get a proper symbolized stack trace.

NOTE: For more information on AddressSanitizer, please see the
http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html[ASAN web page].

=== Running tests with the clang Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSAN) enabled


Similar to the above, you can use a special set of clang flags to enable the Undefined
Behavior Sanitizer. This will generate errors on certain pieces of code which may
not themselves crash but rely on behavior which isn't defined by the C++ standard
(and thus are likely bugs). To enable UBSAN, follow the same directions as for
ASAN above, but pass the `-DKUDU_USE_UBSAN=1` flag to the `cmake` invocation.

In order to get a stack trace from UBSan, you can use gdb on the failing test, and
set a breakpoint as follows:

----
(gdb) b __ubsan::Diag::~Diag
----

Then, when the breakpoint fires, gather a backtrace as usual using the `bt` command.

=== Running tests with the tcmalloc memory leak checker enabled


You can also run the tests with a tcmalloc feature that prints an error message
and aborts if it detects memory leaks in your program.

[source,bash]
----
$ rm -Rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
$ cmake .
$ make -j
$ # Note: LP_BIND_NOW=1 required below, see: https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/issues/detail?id=497
$ PPROF_PATH=thirdparty/installed/bin/pprof HEAPCHECK=normal LD_BIND_NOW=1 ctest -j8
----

NOTE: For more information on the heap checker, please see:
  http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/heap_checker.html

NOTE: The AddressSanitizer doesn't play nice with tcmalloc, so sadly the
HEAPCHECK environment has no effect if you have enabled ASAN. However, recent
versions of ASAN will also detect leaks, so the tcmalloc leak checker is of
limited utility.

=== Running tests with ThreadSanitizer enabled

NOTE: this requires a relatively recent version of clang\+\+, and may also require
a relatively recent version of libstdc\+\+ on your system. It seems to work reasonably
well on Ubuntu 13.10, but YMMV.

ThreadSanitizer (TSAN) is a clang feature which can detect improperly synchronized access to data
along with many other threading bugs. To enable TSAN, pass `-DKUDU_USE_TSAN=1` to the `cmake`
invocation, recompile, and run tests.

. Enabling TSAN supressions while running tests
[NOTE]
====
Note that we rely on a list of runtime suppressions in _build-support/tsan-suppressions.txt_.
If you simply run a unit test like _build/latest/foo-test_, you won't get these suppressions.
Instead, use a command like:

[source,bash]
----
$ ctest -R foo-test
----

...and then view the logs in _build/test-logs/_

In order for all of the suppressions to work, you need libraries with debug
symbols installed, particularly for libstdc\+\+. On Ubuntu 13.10, the package
libstdc++6-4.8-dbg is needed for TSAN builds to pass. It's not a bad idea to
install debug symbol packages for libboost, libc, and cyrus-sasl as well.
====

TSAN may truncate a few lines of the stack trace when reporting where the error
is. This can be bewildering. It's documented for TSANv1 here:
http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAlgorithm
It is not mentioned in the documentation for TSANv2, but has been observed.
In order to find out what is _really_ happening, set a breakpoint on the TSAN
report in GDB using the following incantation:

[source,bash]
----
$ gdb -ex 'set disable-randomization off' -ex 'b __tsan::PrintReport' ./some-test
----


=== Generating code coverage reports


In order to generate a code coverage report, you must build with gcc (not clang)
and use the following flags:

[source,bash]
----
$ cmake -DKUDU_GENERATE_COVERAGE=1 .
$ make -j4
$ ctest -j4
----

This will generate the code coverage files with extensions .gcno and .gcda. You can then
use a tool like `lcov` or `gcovr` to visualize the results. For example, using gcovr:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir cov_html
$ ./thirdparty/gcovr-3.0/scripts/gcovr -r src/
----

Or using `lcov` (which seems to produce better HTML output):

[source,bash]
----
$ lcov  --capture --directory src --output-file coverage.info
$ genhtml coverage.info --output-directory out
----

=== Running lint checks


Kudu uses cpplint.py from Google to enforce coding style guidelines. You can run the
lint checks via cmake using the `ilint` target:

[source,bash]
----
$ make ilint
----

This will scan any file which is dirty in your working tree, or changed since the last
gerrit-integrated upstream change in your git log. If you really want to do a full
scan of the source tree, you may use the `lint` target instead.

== Improving build times

=== Caching build output

The kudu build is compatible with ccache. Simply install your distro's _ccache_ package,
prepend _/usr/lib/ccache_ to your `PATH`, and watch your object files get cached. Link
times won't be affected, but you will see a noticeable improvement in compilation
times. You may also want to increase the size of your cache using "ccache -M new_size".

=== Improving linker speed

One of the major time sinks in the Kudu build is linking. GNU ld is historically
quite slow at linking large C++ applications. The alternative linker `gold` is much
better at it. It's part of the `binutils` package in modern distros (try `binutils-gold`
in older ones). To enable it, simply repoint the _/usr/bin/ld_ symlink from `ld.bfd` to
`ld.gold`.

Note that gold doesn't handle weak symbol overrides properly (see
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16979[this bug report] for details).
As such, it cannot be used with shared objects (see below) because it'll cause
tcmalloc's alternative malloc implementation to be ignored.

=== Building Kudu with dynamic linking

Kudu can be built into shared objects, which, when used with ccache, can result in a
dramatic build time improvement in the steady state. Even after a `make clean` in the build
tree, all object files can be served from ccache. By default, `debug` and `fastdebug` will
use dynamic linking, while other build types will use static linking. To enable
dynamic linking explicitly, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ cmake -DKUDU_LINK=dynamic .
----

Subsequent builds will create shared objects instead of archives and use them when
linking the kudu binaries and unit tests. The full range of options for `KUDU_LINK` are
`static`, `dynamic`, and `auto`. The default is `auto` and only the first letter
matters for the purpose of matching.

NOTE: Dynamic linking is incompatible with ASAN and static linking is incompatible
with TSAN.


== Developing Kudu in Eclipse

Eclipse can be used as an IDE for Kudu. To generate Eclipse project files, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
$ cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" .
----

It's critical that _CMakeCache.txt_ be removed prior to running the generator,
otherwise the extra Eclipse generator logic (the CMakeFindEclipseCDT4.make module)
won't run and standard system includes will be missing from the generated project.

By default, the Eclipse CDT indexer will index everything under the _kudu/_ source tree.
It tends to choke on certain complicated source files within _thirdparty/llvm_.
In some versions of CDT, the indexer will generate an error and stop indexing. In
others, it'll spin forever.

Either way, _thirdparty/llvm_ must be excluded from indexing. An easy way to do this is
to exclude all the unnecessary source trees from within _thirdparty/_ (all we need are
the installed headers). To do this, right click on the project in the Project Explorer
and select Properties. In the dialog box, select "C/C++ Project Paths", select the
Source tab, highlight "Exclusion filter: (None)", and click "Edit...". In the new
dialog box, click "Add Multiple...". In the file chooser, select everything under
thirdparty except for 'installed'. Click OK all the way out and rebuild the
project index by right clicking the project in the Project Explorer and selecting
Index --> Rebuild.

With these exclusions, the only false positives (shown as "red squigglies") that CDT
presents appear to be in atomicops functions (`NoBarrier_CompareAndSwap` for example).

Another Eclipse annoyance stems from the "[Targets]" linked resource that Eclipse
generates for each unit test. These are probably used for building within Eclipse,
but one side effect is that nearly every source file appears in the indexer twice:
once via a target and once via the raw source file. To fix this, simply delete the
[Targets] linked resource via the Project Explorer. Doing this should have no effect
on writing code, though it may affect your ability to build from within Eclipse.


== Building on OSX

It's currently only possible to run `cmake .` on OSX, which will build all the third
party libraries. Building Kudu itself isn't supported.

Requirements:

 - OSX 10.9 and above.
 - Xcode's command line tools (xcode-select --install)
 - Homebrew packages:
   - autoconf
   - automake
   - libtool
   - coreutils
