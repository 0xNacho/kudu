      valuable and important ways to get involved that suit any skill set and level.

    <h3>File bugs and enhancement requests.</h3>
    <p>
      If you see problems in Kudu or you think a feature would make Kudu more useful to you, let us
      know by filing a bug or request for enhancement on the
      <a href="https://issues.cloudera.org/projects/KUDU">Kudu issue tracker</a>. The more
      information you can provide about how to reproduce an issue or
      how you'd like a new feature to work, the better.

    <h3>Review patches and test code.</h3>
    <p>
      In order for patches to be integrated into Kudu as quickly as possible, they must be reviewed
      and tested. The more eyes, the better. Even if you are not a committer, your input is extremely
      valuable. Keep an eye on the
      <a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/q/status:open+project:kudu">Kudu gerrit instance</a>
      for patches that need review or testing.

    <h3>Write and review documentation.</h3>
    <p>
      Good documentation makes great software even better. Where you see gaps in the documentation,
      submit suggestions, corrections, or documentation patches. You can also correct or edit error messages,
      log messages, or API documentation. If you'd like to translate the Kudu documentation into a different
      language or you'd like to help in some other way, let us know. Review the
      <a href="docs/style_guide.html">documentation guidelines</a> before you get started.

    <h3>Request and review examples.</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples">kudu-examples</a> repository includes
      working code examples. As more examples are requested and added, they will need review and clean-up.
      This is another way you can get involved.
