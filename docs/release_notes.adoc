[[rn_1.5.0]]

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2013[KUDU-2013]
  The Java Kudu client now automatically requests new authentication tokens
  after expiration. So, long-lived Java clients are now supported.

[[rn_1.5.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Kudu 1.5 now enables the optional ability to compute, store, and verify
  checksums on all pieces of data stored on a server by default. Due to
  storage format changes, downgrading to versions 1.3 or earlier is not
  supported and will result in an error.

* Spark 2.2+ requires Java 8 at runtime even though Kudu Spark 2.x integration
  is Java 7 compatible. Spark 2.2 is the default dependency version as of
  Kudu 1.5.0.

* The kudu-spark-tools module has been renamed to include the Spark and
  Scala base versions. This matches the pattern used in the kudu-spark
  module and artifacts. The kudu-spark-tools.jar is now called
  kudu-spark2-tools_2.11.jar

[[rn_1.5.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* Support for Java 7 is deprecated as of Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next major release.

* Support for Spark 1 is deprecated as of Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next minor release.

[[rn_1.5.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.5.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.5 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.5 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.4 and Kudu 1.5 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.5 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.5 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.5 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.5.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.5.0

[[rn_1.5.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility
* The Kudu 1.5 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.4. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.4 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.5 client library and
  vice-versa, unless one of the following newly added APIs is used:

* The Kudu 1.5 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.4.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.4 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.5 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.5 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.4
  client library unless they use one of the following new APIs:

* The Kudu 1.5 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.4. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.4 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.5 client
  and vice-versa.
