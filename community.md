* Curt Monash from DBMS2 has written a three-part series about Kudu:
  [an introduction to Kudu](http://www.dbms2.com/2015/09/28/introduction-to-cloudera-kudu/),
  a [technical deep dive](http://www.dbms2.com/2015/09/28/cloudera-kudu-deep-dive/),
  and his analysis on
  [the potential significance of Kudu](http://www.dbms2.com/2015/09/28/the-potential-significance-of-cloudera-kudu/).
* Zoomdata has created a video demo of
  [Zoomdata on top of Kudu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck_kRb6qLKE)
  demonstrating real-time and point-in-time analytic queries on Kudu while
  simultaneously running a streaming ingest workload.
