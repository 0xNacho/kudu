# This file describes the settings to be used by doxygen (www.doxygen.org)
# to generate Kudu C++ client API documentation.  Current contents of the file
# is based on template generated by doxygen v1.8.10.  After the template file
# was generated, all parameters with default values were removed
# along with corresponding comments.  Only relevant parameters
# with custom settings are left.
#

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated.  This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.  Here we generate
# documentation for Kudu C++ client API.
PROJECT_NAME           = "Kudu C++ client API"

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files.  You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject.  Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.  Current empty value reflects the fact that working directory where
# doxygen runs is the location where necessary directory structure
# with header files resides.
INPUT                  =

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.  Due to current layout of the header
# file to process, the recursive scan for files is turned on.
RECURSIVE              = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files.  This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.
EXCLUDE                = @DOXY_CLIENT_API_EXCLUDE@

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.
# We add information about the Kudu version the documentation is generated for.
HTML_FOOTER            = @DOXY_CLIENT_API_FOOTER@


# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written.  If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started.  If
# left blank the current directory will be used.  Current value is set by
# one of make targets while generating the Kudu C++ client API documentation.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = @DOXY_CLIENT_API_OUTDIR@

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. Do not be too verbose: QUIET is set to YES,
# so informational messages are off.
QUIET                  = YES

# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for functions that
# are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters or return
# value.  If set to NO, doxygen will only warn about wrong or incomplete
# parameter documentation, but not about the absence of documentation.
# We want to have those warnings on for now.
WARN_NO_PARAMDOC       = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# As for now, documentation in LaTeX format is not needed.
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
