[[rn_1.4.0]]

[[rn_1.4.0_new_features]]
== New features


== Optimizations and improvements

* Kudu servers, by default, will now only allow unencrypted or unauthenticated connections
  from trusted subnets, which are private networks (127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,
  192.168.0.0/16,169.254.0.0/16) and local subnets of all local network interfaces.
  Unencrypted or unauthenticated connections from publicly routable IPs will be rejected,
  even if encryption and authentication are not configured.
+
The trusted subnets can be configured using the `--trusted_subnets` flag, which can be set
   to IP blocks represented in CIDR notation separated by comma. Set it to '0.0.0.0/0' to
   allow unauthenticated connections from all remote IP addresses. However, if network access
   is not otherwise restricted by a firewall, malicious users may be able to gain unauthorized
   access. This can be mitigated if authentication and encryption are configured to be
   required.
