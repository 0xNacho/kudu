    <h3>Data Model</h3>
    <p>
      A Kudu cluster stores tables that look just like tables you're used to from relational (SQL) databases.
      A table can be as simple as an binary <code>key</code> and <code>value</code>, or as complex
      as a few hundred different strongly-typed attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like SQL, every table has a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> made up of one or more columns.
      This might be a single column like a unique user identifier, or a compound key such as a
      <code>(host, metric, timestamp)</code> tuple for a machine time series database. Rows can be efficiently
      read, updated, or deleted by their primary key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kudu's simple data model makes it breeze to port legacy applications or build new ones:
      no need to worry about how to encode your data into binary blobs or make sense of a
      huge database full of hard-to-interpret JSON. Tables are self-describing, so you can
      use standard tools like SQL engines or Spark to analyze your data.

    <h3>Low-latency random access</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike other storage for big data analytics, Kudu isn't just a file format. It's a live storage
      system which supports low-latency millisecond-scale access to individual rows. You can choose
      between Java or C++ APIs, with Python support under development. And of course these random access
      APIs can be used in conjunction with batch access for machine learning or analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kudu's APIs are designed to be easy to use. The data model is fully typed, so you don't
      need to worry about binary encodings or exotic serialization. You can just store primitive
      types, like when you use JDBC or ODBC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kudu isn't designed to be an OLTP system, but if you have some subset of data which fits
      in memory, it offers competitive random access performance. We've measured 99th percentile
      latencies of 6ms or below using YCSB with a uniform random access workload over a billion
      rows. Being able to run low-latency online workloads on the same storage as back-end
      data analytics can dramatically simplify application architecture.

    <h3>Integration with the Hadoop Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>
      Kudu was designed to fit in with the Hadoop ecosystem, and integrating it with other
      data processing frameworks is simple. You can stream data in from live real-time data sources
      using the Java client, and then process it immediately upon arrival using Spark, Impala,
      or MapReduce. You can even transparently join Kudu tables with data stored in other Hadoop
      storage such as HDFS or HBase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kudu is a good citizen on a Hadoop cluster: it can easily share data
      disks with HDFS DataNodes, and can operate in a RAM footprint as small as 1 GB for
      light workloads.

    <h3>Built by and for Operators</h3>
    <p>
      Kudu was built by a group of engineers who have spent many late nights providing
      on-call production support for critical Hadoop clusters across hundreds of
      enterprise use cases. We know how frustrating it is to debug software
      without good metrics, tracing, or administrative tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in its first beta release, Kudu includes advanced in-process tracing capabilities,
      extensive metrics support, and even watchdog threads which check for latency
      outliers and dump "smoking gun" stack traces to get to the root of the problem
      quickly.

    <h3><a name="opensource">Open Source</a></h3>
    <p>
      Kudu is Open Source software, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Although
      most of the contributions have been from developers from a single company
      up to this point, we believe that Kudu's long-term success depends on
      building a vibrant community of developers and users from diverse organizations and backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first order of business is to migrate all of our code reviews and
      daily development discussions into the open. We're also working on proposing
      Kudu for inclusion in the Apache Software Foundation's Incubator. With
      several Apache Members and Committers on the development team, we are
      familiar with the Apache Way and looking forward to contributing this
      project to the ASF.

    <h3>Super-fast Columnar Storage</h3>
    <p>
      Like most modern analytic data stores, Kudu internally organizes its data by column rather than
      row. Columnar storage allows efficient encoding and compression. For example, a string field with
      only a few unique values can use only a few bits per row of storage. With techniques such as
      run-length encoding, differential encoding, and vectorized bit-packing, Kudu is as fast at
      reading the data as it is space-efficient at storing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columnar storage also dramatically reduces the amount of data IO required to service analytic
      queries. Using techniques such as lazy data materialization and predicate pushdown, Kudu can perform
      drill-down and needle-in-a-haystack queries over billions of rows and terabytes of data in seconds.

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Distribution and Fault Tolerance</h3>
    <p>
      In order to scale out to large datasets and large clusters, Kudu splits tables
      into smaller units called <em>tablets</em>. This splitting can be configured
      on a per-table basis to be based on hashing, range partitioning, or a combination
      thereof. This allows the operator to easily trade off between parallelism for
      analytic workloads and high concurrency for more online ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to keep your data safe and available at all times, Kudu uses the
      <a href="http://raft.github.io">Raft</a> consensus algorithm to replicate
      all operations for a given tablet. Raft, like Paxos, ensures that every
      write is persisted by at least two nodes before responding to
      the client request, ensuring that no data is ever lost due to a
      machine failure. When machines do fail, replicas reconfigure
      themselves within a few seconds to maintain extremely high system
      availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of majority consensus provides very low tail latencies
      even when some nodes may be stressed by concurrent workloads such as
      MapReduce jobs or heavy Impala queries. But unlike eventual
      consistency systems, Raft consensus ensures that all replicas will
      come to agreement around the state of the data, and by using a
      combination of logical and physical clocks, Kudu can offer strict
      snapshot consistency to clients that demand it.

    <h3>Designed for Next-Generation Hardware</h3>
    <p>
      The Kudu team has worked closely with engineers at Intel to harness the power
      of the next generation of hardware technologies.
      Kudu's storage is designed to take advantage of the IO
      characteristics of solid state drives, and it includes an
      experimental cache implementation based on the <a href="http://pmem.io">libpmem</a>
      library which can store data in persistent memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kudu is implemented in C++, so it can scale easily to large amounts
      of memory per node. And because key storage data structures are designed to
      be highly concurrent, it can scale easily to tens of cores. With an
      in-memory columnar execution path, Kudu achieves good instruction-level
      parallelism using SIMD operations from the SSE4 and AVX instruction sets.
