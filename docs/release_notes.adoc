[[rn_1.2.0]]

[[rn_1.2.0_new_features]]
== New features


== Optimizations and improvements


=== Command line tools


== Wire protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.2.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.2 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0. If the client uses features
  that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.2 without limitations.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.1 and Kudu 1.2 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
