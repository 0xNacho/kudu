This directory contains a demo which ingests the Twitter firehose
into Kudu.

Building this requires some dependencies which are not in our thirdparty/
directory:
  Ubuntu: apt-get -y install liboauth-dev libcurl-dev
  RHEL6: yum -y install liboauth-devel curl-devel

By default, the demo uses the KuduProject twitter account's API keys
to connect to the sample firehose. Use the available command-line
flags to use a different account.
