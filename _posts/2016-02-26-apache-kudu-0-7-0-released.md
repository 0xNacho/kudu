This latest version has a number of improvements since 0.6.0:

* Several improvements to the Java client including better error handling support and fixes for a potential client hang.
* Better platform support, including support for building on RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and SLES 12.
* The Kudu Python client has been completely revamped and is now considered a supported feature.
* Numerous bug fixes and small improvements for better stability, performance, and usability.

Thanks to Jean-Daniel Cryans for managing this release, as well as to all those who contributed or provided feedback and bug reports.
