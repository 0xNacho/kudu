<h1>Known Issues and Limitations</h1>
      <div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_schema_and_usage_limitations"><a class="link" href="#_schema_and_usage_limitations">Schema and Usage Limitations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kudu is primarily designed for analytic use cases. You are likely to encounter issues if
a single row contains multiple kilobytes of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The columns which make up the primary key must be listed first in the schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Columns that are part of the primary key cannot be renamed.
The primary key may not be changed after the table is created.
You must drop and recreate a table to select a new primary key
or rename key columns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary key of a row may not be modified using the <code>UPDATE</code> functionality.
To modify a row&#8217;s primary key, the row must be deleted and re-inserted with
the modified key. Such a modification is non-atomic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Columns with <code>DOUBLE</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, or <code>BOOL</code> types are not allowed as part of a
primary key definition. Additionally, all columns that are part of a primary
key definition must be <code>NOT NULL</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type and nullability of existing columns cannot be changed by altering the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dropping a column does not immediately reclaim space. Compaction must run first.
There is no way to run compaction manually, but dropping the table will reclaim the
space immediately.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="_partitioning_limitations"><a class="link" href="#_partitioning_limitations">Partitioning Limitations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tables must be manually pre-split into tablets using simple or compound primary
keys. Automatic splitting is not yet possible. Range partitions may be added
or dropped after a table has been created. See
<a href="schema_design.html">Schema Design</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data in existing tables cannot currently be automatically repartitioned. As a workaround,
create a new table with the new partitioning and insert the contents of the old
table.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_replication_and_backup_limitations"><a class="link" href="#_replication_and_backup_limitations">Replication and Backup Limitations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kudu does not currently include any built-in features for backup and restore.
Users are encouraged to use tools such as Spark or Impala to export or import
tables as necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_impala_limitations"><a class="link" href="#_impala_limitations">Impala Limitations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updates, inserts, and deletes via Impala are non-transactional. If a query
fails part of the way through, its partial effects will not be rolled back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No timestamp and decimal type support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum parallelism of a single query is limited to the number of tablets
in a table. For good analytic performance, aim for 10 or more tablets per host
or use large tables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_security_limitations"><a class="link" href="#_security_limitations">Security Limitations</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authorization is only available at a system-wide, coarse-grained level. Table-level,
column-level, and row-level authorization features are not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data encryption at rest is not built in. Kudu has been reported to run correctly
on systems using local block device encryption (e.g. <code>dmcrypt</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu server Kerberos principals must follow the pattern <code>kudu/&lt;HOST&gt;@DEFAULT.REALM</code>.
Configuring an alternate Kerberos principal is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu&#8217;s integration with Apache Flume does not support writing to Kudu clusters that
require Kerberos authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kudu client instances retrieve authentication tokens upon first contact with the
cluster. These tokens expire after one week. Use of a single Kudu client instance
for more than one week is not supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following are known bugs and issues with the current release of Kudu. They will
be addressed in later releases. Note that this list is not exhaustive, and is meant
to communicate only the most important known issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the Kudu master is configured with the <code>-log_force_fsync_all</code> option, tablet servers
and clients will experience frequent timeouts, and the cluster may become unusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tablet server has a very large number of tablets, it may take several minutes
to start up. It is recommended to limit the number of tablets per server to 100 or fewer.
Consider this limitation when pre-splitting your tables. If you notice slow start-up times,
you can monitor the number of tablets per server in the web UI.</p>
