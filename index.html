    <h3>Streamlined Architecture</h3>
    <p>Kudu provides a combo of fast inserts/updates and efficient columnar scans to enable multiple real-time analytic workloads across a single storage layer. As a new complement to HDFS and Apache HBase, Kudu gives architects the flexibility to address a wider variety of use cases without exotic workarounds.</p>

    <h3>Faster Analytics</h3>
    <p>Kudu is specifically designed for use cases that require fast analytics on fast (rapidly changing) data. Engineered  to take advantage of  next-generation hardware and in-memory processing, Kudu lowers query latency significantly for Impala and Apache Spark (initially, with  other execution engines to come).</p>
