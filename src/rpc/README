Intro
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The RPC layer makes communication with remote processes look like local
function calls.  You can make either asynchronous calls, in which you provide a
callback which is invoked later, or synchronous calls, where your thread blocks
until the remote system responds.

This code will be compatible with the Hadoop IPC layer in hadoop-3 and beyond.
This will allow us to re-use the Hadoop IPC code in our Java client. The current
implementation is a step along the way, but is missing the connection setup
step which performs authentication, the SASL handshake, etc.

We use protocol buffers for serialization, and libev for non-blocking I/O.

For some code examples, look in rpc-test.cc.

Each reactor has a thread which uses epoll to handle many sockets using
non-blocking I/O.  Blocking calls are implemented by the Proxy using
non-blocking calls-- from the point of view of the Messenger, all calls are
non-blocking.

The acceptor pool and the service pool are optional components.  If you don't
expect anyone to be connecting to you, you do not have to start them. If a server
expects to listen on multiple ports (eg for different protocols), multiple
AcceptorPools may be attached.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxy classes are used by the client to send calls to a remote service.
Calls may be made synchronously or asynchronously -- the synchronous calls are simply
a wrapper around the asynchronous version, which makes the call and then waits
on the callback to be triggered.

In order to make a call, the user must provide a method name, a request protobuf,
a response protobuf, an RpcController, and a callback.

Each RpcController object corresponds to exactly one in-flight call on the client.
This class is where per-call settings may be adjusted before making an RPC --
currently this is just timeout functionality, but in the future may include
other call properties such as tracing information, priority classes, deadline
propagation, etc.

Upon issuing the asynchronous request, the RPC layer enqueues the call to be sent
to the server and immediately returns. During this period, the caller thread
may continue to send other RPCs or perform other processing while waiting for
the callback to be triggered. In the future, we will provide an RPC cancellation
function on the RpcController object in case the user determines that the call
is no longer required.

When the call completes, the RPC layer will invoke the provided ResponseCallback
function from within the context of the reactor thread. Given this,
ResponseCallbacks should be careful to never block, as it would prevent other
threads from concurrent sending or receiving RPCs.

The callback is invoked exactly one time, regardless of the call's termination state.
The user can determine the call's state by invoking methods on the RpcController object,
for example to determine whether the call succeded, timed out, or suffered a
transport error. In the case that the call succeeds, the user-provided response protobuf
will have been initialized to contain the result.

Please see the accompanying documentation in the Proxy and RpcController classes
for more information on the specific API, as well as the test cases in rpc-test.cc
for example usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generated Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, clients will use auto-generated subclasses of Proxy and ServiceIf to
get additional type safety and nicer APIs.

The generated proxy object has the same API as the generic Proxy, except that
methods are generated for each RPC defined within the protobuf service. Each
RPC has a synchronous and async version, corresponding to Proxy::AsyncRequest and
Proxy::SyncRequest. These generated methods have an identical API to the generic
one except that they are type-safe and do not require the method name to be passed.

The generated ServiceIf class contains pure virtual methods for each of the RPCs
in the service. Each method to be implemented has an API like:

  void MethodName(const RequestPB *req,
     ResponsePB *resp, ::kudu::rpc::RpcContext *context);

The request PB is the user-provided request, and the response PB is a cleared
protobuf ready to store the RPC response. Once the RPC response has been filled in,
the service should call context->RespondSuccess(). This method may be called
from any thread in the application at any point either before or after the
actual handler method returns.

In the case of an unexpected error, the generated code may alternatively call
context->RespondFailure(...). However, for any error responses which should be
parseable by the client code, it is preferable to define an error response inside
the response protobuf itself -- this is a much more flexible way of returning
actionable information with an error, given that Status just holds a string
and not much else.

See rpc/rpc-test-base.h for an example service implementation, as well as the
documentation comments in rpc/service_if.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ServiceIf classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ServiceIf classes are abstract interfaces that the server implements to handle
incoming RPCs.  In general, each generated service has several virtual methods
which you can override in order to implement the relevant function call.

There is a ServicePool which you can use to coordinate several worker threads
handling callbacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wire Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current wire protocol (this will change slightly in the future when we add
Hadoop compatibility)

Currently, when the client connects to the server, there is no setup/negotation.
This is a TODO that we will be addressing in coming weeks. After successfully
connecting, the client may immediately begin sending calls.

Each call that the clients make is serialized as following:

  total_size: (32-bit big-endian integer)
    the size of the rest of the message, not including this 4-byte header

  header: varint-prefixed RequestHeader protobuf
    see rpc_header.proto for fields

  request: varint-prefixed user request protobuf
    this is the user-defined call parameter

An example call (captured with strace on rpc-test.cc) follows:

   "\x00\x00\x00\x17"   (total_size: 23 bytes to follow)
   "\x09"  RequestHeader varint: 9 bytes
    "\x08\x0a\x1a\x03\x41\x64\x64\x20\x01" (RequestHeader protobuf)
      Decoded with protoc --decode=RequestHeader rpc_header.proto:
      callId: 10
      methodName: "Add"
      requestParam: true

   "\x0c"  Request parameter varint: 12 bytes
    "\x08\xd4\x90\x80\x91\x01\x10\xf8\xcf\xc4\xed\x04" Request parameter
      Decoded with protoc --decode=kudu.rpc_test.AddRequestPB rpc/rtest.proto 
      x: 304089172
      y: 1303455736

The response is serialized similarly, with only some small differences:

  - The header is a ResponseHeader protobuf instead of RequestHeader.
  - If ResponseHeader.is_error is true, then the response protobuf will
    be an ErrorStatusPB message, instead of the response protobuf type
    defined by the service.
